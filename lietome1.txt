you don’t understand 
i’m not ever like this 
i can hold breath
say ill be alright 
but kinda hard to think 
when i can’t feel a thing 
so tell me to my face
already heard it last week 
driving me insane
it’s hitting real badly 
tell me what’s her name 
 
said you’d never, why’d you ever 
lie to me baby lie, lie to me
lie to me baby lie, lie to me 
lie to me baby lie, lie to me
yeah 
said you’d never, why’d you ever 
lie to me baby lie, lie to me
lie to me baby lie, lie to me 
lie to me baby lie, lie to me
 
After everything we been through you come crying to me
You said you’d never lie so why you lying to me?
I gave you my trust my heart and everything inside of me
Tell me how’d you pay me back? You made a fool out of me
 
Can’t you see what your doing? Left me, Broken In pieces 
Got me feeling so stupid ; guess I needed a reason
To let go, 
I don’t wanna hear lies anymore 
 
said you’d never, why’d you ever 
lie to me baby lie, lie to me
lie to me baby lie, lie to me 
lie to me baby lie, lie to me
yeah 
said you’d never, why’d you ever 
lie to me baby lie, lie to me
lie to me baby lie, lie to me 
lie to me baby lie, lie to me

i’ve been tryna collect all my thoughts 
it’s all said and done 
just don’t feel the same
Don’t try to tell me that I was wrong 
You was the one lying all along
I think you just want somebody else to take the blame 

said you’d never, why’d you ever 
lie to me baby lie, lie to me
lie to me baby lie, lie to me 
lie to me baby lie, lie to me
yeah 
said you’d never, why’d you ever 
lie to me baby lie, lie to me
lie to me baby lie, lie to me 
lie to me baby lie, lie to me
